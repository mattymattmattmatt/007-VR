/*
 * gevr_shim.h - the seam between the GoldenEye engine and the VR layer.
 *
 * Everything in this header is a no-op unless GE_VR is defined. The N64 ROM
 * target never defines it, so the matching build sees an empty translation
 * unit and unchanged call sites. joy.c in particular contains code commented
 * "required for matching", so the guards are not optional politeness.
 *
 * Call order for one VR frame:
 *
 *   gevr_shim_frame_begin()      once, before the game ticks
 *   gevr_shim_get_pads()         after joyConsumeSamplesWrapper()
 *   ... the game ticks as normal ...
 *   for each eye:
 *       gevr_shim_begin_eye(e)
 *       ... the game renders its display list ...
 *       gevr_shim_end_eye(e)
 *   gevr_shim_frame_end()
 *
 * The engine keeps ownership of movement, collision and hitscan. The VR layer
 * only supplies input and per-eye view/projection.
