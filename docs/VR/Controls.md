# Controls

## Why Goodhead

GoldenEye ships eight control styles. Four of them (2.1 Plenty, 2.2 Galore,
2.3 Domino, 2.4 Goodhead) read **two** N64 controllers, splitting aiming and
movement across two sticks. That is twin-stick, in 1997.

Tracing the routing in `src/game/bondview2.c` for the 2.x branch:

```
pad 0  stick X -> moveData.analogTurn      pad 1  stick X -> moveData.analogStrafe
pad 0  stick Y -> moveData.analogPitch     pad 1  stick Y -> moveData.analogWalk
pad 0  Z       -> insightaimmode           pad 1  Z       -> fire
```

2.4 Goodhead is the variant where pad 1 supplies strafe *and* walk, leaving
pad 0 as a pure aim stick. That is exactly the shape a VR port wants, so the
layer synthesises two pads and lets the engine's own code consume them. No
player movement code is modified.

`gevr_shim_inject_pads()` forces the style to Goodhead every frame, so a stray
change in the options menu cannot quietly break the mapping mid-level.

## The mapping

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Left stick | Move — strafe and walk |
| Right stick | Turn — snap by default |
| Head | Look. Pitch and yaw both come from the headset |
| Right trigger | Fire |
| Left trigger | Aim mode |
| A | Use / action |
| B | Change weapon |
| Y | Pause / watch menu |
| Left grip | Crouch (engine-dependent, see below) |
| X | Recentre |

Rebind any of these in `gevr.ini`. An action keeps its N64 pad and button
whatever you bind it to, because the pad split is what makes twin-stick work —
moving `fire` to a different button still sends pad 1's Z.

## Head control, and why there is a servo

The engine owns the camera angles (`vv_theta`, `vv_verta`) and uses them for
hitscan. If VR simply drew from the headset pose and left those angles alone,
you would look at a guard and shoot the wall.

So the layer runs a proportional controller. Each frame it takes the error
between where the headset is pointing and where the engine thinks the camera
is pointing, and emits an aim-stick deflection proportional to it. Because the
engine treats that stick as a turn *rate*, a P term on angle error is the
natural pairing: it converges without oscillating. Defaults settle a 30° snap
in about four frames at 90 Hz.

Two details this gets right, both covered by tests:

- **The view does not wait for the servo.** The camera is rendered from the
  live headset pose, not the engine's angles. A one-frame lag in the engine is
  invisible; a one-frame lag in the horizon is nauseating.
- **The error wraps.** Facing 175° with the engine at −175° is a 10° error, not
  350°. Without that, the player spins on their heel at the seam.

`invert_pitch` flips the emitted stick, not the angle the servo aims for.
Inverting the target instead makes the camera converge on the mirror image of
where you are looking and then run away to the pitch limit — this was a real
bug during development, and there is now a regression test for it.

## Aiming with the controller

With `aim_mode = controller`, the right hand aims the gun independently of
your view — but only in aim mode, because that is the only place the engine
supports it. Holding aim mode freezes natural turning and pans the crosshair
instead, driven by the aim stick past ±60. The layer steers that band from how
far your right hand points away from your view.

Outside aim mode the gun follows the view, which is how the game works flat.

## Deadzones, and the notch

The engine treats `|stick| <= 5` as dead and subtracts 5 from what is left, so
the usable range is 5..80, not 0..80. Everything the layer emits adds that
notch back on — otherwise the first 6% of every stick throw is silently eaten
and the controls feel numb around centre.

Stick deadzones are radial rather than per-axis. A per-axis deadzone carves a
square hole out of the stick and makes diagonal movement snag on the way in.

## Comfort

- **Snap turn** by default, 30°, with hysteresis so holding the stick over
  turns once rather than once per frame.
- **Vignette** that narrows the field of view while you move, scaled by speed.
  The falloff is deliberately soft; a hard edge reads as a black ring.
- **Recentre** on X, which rewrites the play-space origin. It keeps only yaw —
  carrying pitch or roll into the origin would tilt the horizon.
- **Physical crouch** works through head height, no button needed. The
  `crouch` binding is separate and marked engine-dependent because GoldenEye's
  own ducking is tied to aim mode rather than a dedicated button; treat that
  binding as experimental.

## Tuning

Run `ge007vr-calibrate` and edit `gevr.ini`, or pass `--set=key=value` to try a
value without editing anything:

```sh
./ge007vr-calibrate --set=snap_degrees=45 --set=turn_mode=smooth
```

Start with `snap_degrees`, `move_deadzone` and `servo_yaw_gain`. If the view
feels like it drags behind your head, raise the servo gain; if it wobbles when
you stop moving, lower it.
